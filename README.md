## ABOUT

Project for my diploma at Taras Shevchenko University in Kyiv.

It is continuing of my previous project last year, where was developed idea and algorithms of effective find the safest and shortest way out of dangerous area in crisis situation.
Therefor was developed software module to model such situation and demonstrate how that system works.

## GOAL:

Now the goal is to create model of fire spreading using mix of CA(cell automata) and DLA(diffussion limited aggregations).

## TODO:

1. Develop generic software pattern for all kind of crisis situations.
1. Develop interface for system running.
1. Develop a visualization part for demonstrating processes.
1. Create a fire spreading model *(math part)*.
1. Code the fire spreading model *(code part)*.
1. Test and save the results.
1. Write a dissertation.

## ADDITIONAL GOALS:

- Translate previous project to *(C/C++ | Rust)* language.
- Add *people's behavior in crowd* module.
